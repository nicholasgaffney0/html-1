        </h2>
        <p>
            Pisha Haja, a band from <b>Iceland</b>, started back in <strong>2016</strong> when they first released their album <i>Scottlish</i>. Following the success of <em>Scottlish</em>, Pisha Haja kept themselves busy by putting out their next
            three albums in the same year. The highly anticipated follow up <i>Unleash The Jeash</i> met with <mark>glowing reviews and critical acclaim</mark> put the band to new heights. Pisha went back into the studio to record a <small>short ep</small>
            titled <i>Thunder Road Sessions</i>. Only a short <del>four</del> three months after, they released their most succesful album to date <i>Turbisted</i> and their highly successful single <ins>Pooch Tunes.</ins>

            The release of <i>Turbisted</i> propelled Pisha Haja to international stardom.
            <blockquote>Turbisted changed my life. If it wasn't for the song "I'm Going To Hawaii" I would have never quit my job to go on vacation to Hawaii, where I have been stranded for quite some time.</blockquote> 
            Some say the success of <i>Turbisted</i> has led to the next beatlemania type sensation: <em>Pishamania</em>.
